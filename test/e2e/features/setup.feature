@setup
Feature: Setup assistant
  On a first run the application opens as a short wizard over the ordinary
  control panel — a welcome screen, then at most three optional steps — and
  afterwards it is the control panel. Every step's controls act through the
  page that owns the setting, every exit records a disposition, and under
  --dry-run (every scenario here) nothing is persisted or applied. The suite
  cannot read a real first run, because --dry-run suppresses the automatic
  presentation; @args.--setup opens the assistant the same way.

  Scenario: A dry run never presents the assistant uninvited
    Given ChairLift is running
    Then no dialog is shown
    And the setup dry run would record no disposition

  Scenario: The assistant opens from the main menu on its welcome screen
    Given ChairLift is running
    When I open the main menu
    And I choose "Setup Assistant…" from the menu
    Then a dialog titled "Welcome to Bluefin" is shown
    And the dialog says "Configure Everything"
    And the dialog says "Get Moving"
    And the action journal is empty

  @args.--setup
  Scenario: A launch with --setup opens the assistant over the control panel
    Given ChairLift is running

    And the sidebar lists every navigation page in order
    And the action journal is empty

  @args.--setup
  Scenario: Get Moving records a skip and leaves the control panel as it was
    Given ChairLift is running
    Then a dialog titled "Welcome to Bluefin" is shown
    When I choose "Get Moving" in the dialog
    Then no dialog is shown
    And a toast says "You're ready to go!"
    And the setup dry run would record disposition skipped
    And the sidebar lists every navigation page in order
    And the "Updates" page is shown
    And the action journal is empty

  @args.--setup
  Scenario: Dismissing the assistant with Escape records a skip
    Given ChairLift is running

    And the action journal is empty

    When I choose "Next" in the dialog
    Then the setup assistant shows the "Update Preferences" step
    And the setup assistant offers the "Finish" button
    And the setup assistant does not offer the "Next" button
    And every switch in the setup assistant has an accessible name
    When I choose "Finish" in the dialog
    Then no dialog is shown
